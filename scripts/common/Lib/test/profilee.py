"""
Input for test_profile.py and test_cprofile.py.

IMPORTANT: This stuff is touchy. If you modify anything above the
test class you'll have to regenerate the stats by running the two
test files.

*ALL* NUMBERS in the expected output are relevant.  If you change
the formatting of pstats, please don't just regenerate the expected
output without checking very carefully that not a single number has
changed.

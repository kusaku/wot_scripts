long_description = '\nPympler is a development tool to measure, monitor and analyze the\nmemory behavior of Python objects in a running Python application.\n\nBy pympling a Python application, detailed insight in the size and\nthe lifetime of Python objects can be obtained.  Undesirable or\nunexpected runtime behavior like memory bloat and other "pymples"\ncan easily be identified.\n\nPympler integrates three previously separate projects into a single,\ncomprehensive profiling tool. Asizeof provides basic size information\nfor one or several Python objects, muppy is used for on-line\nmonitoring of a Python application and the class tracker provides\noff-line analysis of the lifetime of selected Python objects. A\nweb profiling frontend exposes process statistics, garbage\nvisualisation and class tracker statistics.\n\nPympler is written entirely in Python, with no dependencies to\nexternal libraries. It has been tested with Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7,\n3.1, 3.2, 3.3 on Linux, Windows and MacOS X.\n'
